# Assignment 6: Hackathon (Climate Change)

The main idea behind the world was that there wouldn’t necessarily be much difference in the look of our daily lives, the vision of utopia/dystopia hasn’t got to the point envisioned in films or science fiction, the hyper-modern city isn’t realised yet, the street life envisioned in Blade Runner, maybe more so. The film Soylent Green from 1973, is more prescient in its vision, and, worryingly set in 2022.
New York is overcrowded, temperatures are in the 40s, people sleep on tenement stairs, some people cycle on repurposed stationary bikes to provide power to light their rooms. Chronic food shortages have forced the government to provide protein supplement food wafers to the population, they are rationed and distributed in dehumanising ways – dumped off lorries in poorer, heavily populated areas.
This contrasts with exclusive walled off districts where the powerful and wealthy have space, lighting, comfortable homes and better-quality food, including fresh meat and vegetables. I took this as my premise and made a banal, everyday scene, that subtly highlights the lack of resources, the inequalities and the fact that while western areas will have slower impacts on their lifestyles, the boiling frog analogy is pertinent.

I developed the idea for the final concept based on various chats we had on where the direction should go. We liked the idea of the conflict between people’s everyday reality and the actual reality of the world around once the effects of climate change were starting to be felt. Time and build constraints would mean a large world would be too much, so I thought that we could make a smaller, more personal, affect. 
Things seem normal at first glance, but then you start to realise that’s not the case. I presented my idea and we then agreed on a few tweaks, like the use of the signs to indicate what resources we available. I built the environment, buildings (except for the shops, which Christina repurposed from a previous project) and designed the lighting. I recorded the audio clips to be triggered at the appropriate time. I directed the overall look of the project.

The programming for the project was done according to what Angela and I discussed for the final simulation. This includes triggering certain audio recordings at specific times when the user interacts with certain characters or objects. Because we wanted the user to be able to interact with the environment, the user can move around the scene and has hands to interact with objects.  For the interaction to be more immersive we wanted the player to have certain objects, but we did not want the user to hold on to a physical object all the simulation, to make this possible we created an inventory system that the player would trigger with one of the controller buttons and they would be able to take the objects out of the inventory when the time was needed. Another piece of code was created for the end of the simulation since at the end all the lights go off and the only visible lights are at “the other side”. 
Some of the objects used are from previous projects, so not everything had to be created from scratch.
